# Hightop

Super convenient group count

```ruby
Visit.top(:browser)
```

instead of

```ruby
Visit.group(:browser).where("browser IS NOT NULL").order("count_all DESC, browser").count
```

Limit the results

```ruby
Visit.limit(10).top(:referring_domain)
```

## Installation

Add this line to your applicationâ€™s Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'hightop'
```

And then execute:

```sh
bundle
```
