# Hightop

Super convenient group count

```ruby
Visit.top(:browser)
```

instead of

```ruby
Visit.group(:browser).where("browser IS NOT NULL").order("count_all DESC, browser").count
```

Be sure to [sanitize user input](http://rails-sqli.org/) like you must with `group`.

Limit the results

```ruby
Visit.top(:referring_domain, 10)
```

Include nil values

```ruby
Visit.top(:search_keyword, nil: true)
```

Works with multiple groups

```ruby
Visit.top([:city, :browser])
```

And expressions

```ruby
Visit.top("LOWER(referring_domain)")
```

And distinct counts

```ruby
Visit.top(:city, uniq: :user_id)
```

## Installation

Add this line to your applicationâ€™s Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'hightop'
```

And then execute:

```sh
bundle
```
